## 📝 How It Works
1. The program defines a function **calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)**:
   - If the discount20% or morere**, it applies the discount.
   - Otherwise, it returns the original price.
2. The user is prompted to enter:
   - The original price of an item.
   - The discount percentage.
3. The program then prints:
   - final pricece** after discount (if applied).
   - Or original pricece** (if no discount was applied).
