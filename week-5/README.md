# Python OOP Assignment

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice.  
It demonstrates **Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism** in Python.

## 🏗️ Activities
### Activity 1: Custom Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class with attributes and methods.  
- Added encapsulation using private attributes and getter/setter methods.  
- Inherited `SmartWatch` from `Smartphone` and demonstrated method overriding.

### Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Built a base `Vehicle` class with a `move()` method.  
- Implemented `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` classes, each defining `move()` differently.  

## 🚀 How to Run
```bash
python assignment.py
